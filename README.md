# tpm-modules

KiCAD (v5.99) designs for Infineon SLB9665 and Infineon SLB9670 based TPM modules.

There are two interfaces: SPI (SLB9670) and LPC (SLB9665). Pinouts for the modules
vary a lot ([manufacturer specific?](https://superuser.com/a/1537838)) but given how
simple the boards are adding new ones should be fairly straightforward. 

If you do end up designing a new module, raise a PR so we can collect them all in one repo.
